# If a pytest section is found in one of the possible config files

# so if you add a pytest config section elsewhere,
# you will need to delete this section from setup.cfg.

# The order of these options matters. testpaths comes after addopts so that
# nameless in testpaths is interpreted as
# --pyargs nameless.
# Any tests in the src/ directory (that is, tests installed with the package)
# can be run by any user with pytest --pyargs nameless.
# Packages that are sensitive to the host machine, most famously NumPy,
# include tests with the installed package so that any user can check
# at any time that everything is working properly.
# If you do choose to make installable tests, this will run the installed
# tests as they are actually installed (same principle as when we ensure that
# we always test the installed version of the package).
# If you have no need for this (and your src/ directory is very large),
# you can save a few milliseconds on testing by telling pytest not to search
# the src/ directory by removing
# --pyargs and nameless from the options here.
